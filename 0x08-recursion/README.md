#0x08. C - Recursion

[Nice video on recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STWnc6ZY2fw)

Examples of Recursion functions
####Factorial
Factorial function(symbol: !) says to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.
Examples:
*4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
So the rule is:
   n! = n × (n−1)!
   "the factorial of any number is that number times the factorial of (that number minus 1)"

Fibonacci Sequence can be written as a rule

The Rule is xn = xn−1 + xn−2

###Tasks
####0-puts_recursion.c
A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
*Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
The standard library provides a similar function: puts.
